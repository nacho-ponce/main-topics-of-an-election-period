This project applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to perform topic modeling on a collection of speeches. The script preprocesses the text data, builds a document-term matrix (DTM), selects the optimal number of topics, and visualizes the results using LDAvis.
To run the script, you will need the speeches.csv file, which is available on opendiscourse.de.
